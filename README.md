# CS 2520 Group Assignment - Cannon Game - George Matta, Mark Haddad, Ayanna Sanges-Chu
This project refactors the given cannon.py from https://github.com/assamidanov/python_programming_class/tree/main/week13, and expands the game by adding new features. The project is focused on functional and object-oriented programming, where each object of the game inherits from one or several of Drawable, Moveable, and Killable abstract class attributes. Different classes such as the Cannon, Projectiles, Targets, and Bombs are implemented in respective Master classes that are then used in the main Manager to run our desired output. Overall, the game allows the user to control a cannon, fighting against enemy cannons and targets that drop bombs.
